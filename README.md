## Project Info: 
For our CSCI 375 final project we decided to work on the Packard Power Rankings website. The main things we hope to accomplish throughout this project are adding in various bug fixes to make the site run much smoother, redesigning the website UI to make it more friendly to end users, and potentially adding in new features.
